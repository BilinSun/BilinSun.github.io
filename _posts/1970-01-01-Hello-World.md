It's 9:30 PM, January 15, 2024.

Not very often do I allow myself the treat of typing down "Hello, World!", for I dislike spoiling this phrase by tagging it on every trivial advancement. Yet opening up a blog the first time is significant enough, so I shall celebrate.

A blogging site is LONG overdue. I could have kept track of my learning so much better. I could also have jotted down pieces of memory for recollection. The real kick, ironically, is the need to present a personal webpage as I apply to some positions. I won't be able to finish this website for the application concerned, but better late than never.

Setting up a blogging site is easier than I expected. I plan to keep it minimalistic for some time.

This site will see a period of anachronistic uploads as I gather up my scattered notes. I will mostly make the indexed blog date the day the note was first written, rather than the day the note gets uploaded, so I can sort the notes in time order later. I may keep the uploaded date in the blog body. The only exception is this blog which is pinned to the big bang of Unix just for prominence.

I hope I could write more but I have to return to my UChicago Civ course reading now.
